# Theographic Bible Metadata - JSON Fields Documentation
This documentation provides a comprehensive reference for the structure and fields of JSON files within the Theographic Bible Metadata dataset.

### Dataset Overview
The JSON files are located in the `json/` directory of the root repository. These files were generated through a Python ETL script from Airtable, where the original data was inputted and continues to be updated. Because of this Airtable origin, you may encounter peculiarities in data structure and field name inconsistencies. Throughout this documentation, JSON files are referred to as "tables" since they directly represent tabular data exported from Airtable.

### Standard JSON Entity Structure
All Theographic JSON entities have three root fields:
- `id` - A 14-character alphanumeric case-sensitive unique record identifier (e.g., `recRAcqtgn28zXm1a`)
- `createdTime` - An ISO 8601/RFC 3339 formatted timestamp (e.g., `2018-06-01T13:12:45.000Z`)
- `fields` - A nested object containing entity-specific data

This documentation focuses exclusively on the fields within the `fields` object. Each section below corresponds to a specific JSON file and details its field names, data types, and relationships with other JSON files. Additionally, each section includes a sample JSON entity from real data to illustrate the structure in practice. Note that sample entities may not contain all possible fields, and some long text values or arrays have been truncated for conciseness.

## Books
This table contains high-level metadata for each of the 66 books in the Protestant Bible canon. It includes various naming conventions (e.g. `osisName`, `bookName`, `shortName`), canonical divisions (`testament`, `bookDiv`), and structural information like chapter and verse counts. It also serves as a sort of central hub, linking to the chapters, verses, writers, people, and places associated with each book.

## Easton
This table contains parsed entries from the 1897 Easton's Bible Dictionary. Each record represents a single dictionary term, providing its label, definition text (`dictText`), and metadata extracted from the source XML at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.xml. Crucially, it links dictionary entries to corresponding records in the `people` and `places` tables, enriching the dataset with historical and theological context.

### Fields Reference (12 Fields)

| Field | Type | Status | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| `dictLookup` | string | Validated | Unique string for a dictionary entry, split out by sub-paragraphs |
| `termID` | string | Unknown | The id attribute of the <term> tag in the source XML. This ID indicates the location of the term within the original document's structure. For example, "a-p1.11" signifies that the term is in the "a" section, and within that section, it is associated with the paragraph block indexed as "p1" and is the 11th tagged element within that block. |
| `termLabel` | string | Validated | Title of the original entry |
| `def_id` | string | Unknown | The id attribute of the <def> tag in the source XML. This ID directly corresponds to the termID and points to the definition block for that specific term. For example, if the termID is "a-p1.11", the corresponding def_id will be "a-p1.12". |
| `has_list` | string | Unknown | A boolean field ("True" or "False") that indicates whether the definition text contains a numbered or itemized list. This is derived from the structure of the source XML, though not explicitly shown in the provided snippet. |
| `itemNum` | integer | Validated | Sub-section number, if multiple sections are listed in one entry |
| `matchType` | string | Temporary | Used to validate scripts which automatically match entities. |
| `matchSlugs` | string | Temporary | Used to check automatically matched slugs of entities in other tables |
| `dictText` | string | Validated | Text of the dictionary entry |
| `personLookup` | array | Populated | Links to the "people" table |
| `placeLookup` | array | Populated | Links to the "places" table |
| `index` | integer | Validated | Unique identifier |

### Relationships

    "has_list": "True",
    "itemNum": 4,
    "matchType": "person",
    "matchSlugs": "joseph_1715",
    "dictText": "The foster-father of our Lord ([Matt. 1:16](/matt#Matt.1.16); [Luke 3:23](/luke#Luke.3.23)). He lived at Nazareth in Galilee ([Luke 2:4](/luke#Luke.2.4)). He is called a “just man.” He was by trade a carpenter ([Matt. 13:55](/matt#Matt.13.55)). He is last mentioned in connection with the journey to Jerusalem, when Jesus was twelve years old. It is probable that he died before Jesus entered on his public ministry. This is concluded from the fact that Mary only was present at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee. His name does not appear in connection with the scenes of the crucifixion along with that of Mary (q.v.), [John 19:25](/john#John.19.25).",

## Events
This table chronicles the timeline of Biblical events. Each record details a specific event with a `title`, chronological data (e.g. `startDate`), and its relationship to other events (`predecessor`, `partOf`).
